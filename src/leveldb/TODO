- Maybe implement DB::BulkDeleteForRcoinnamee(start_key, end_key)
  that would blow away files whose rcoinnamees are entirely contained
  within [start_key..end_key]?  For Chrome, deletion of obsolete
  object stores, etc. can be done in the background anyway, so
  probably not that important.
- There have been requests for MultiGet.

After a rcoinnamee is completely deleted, what gets rid of the
corresponding files if we do no future chcoinnamees to that rcoinnamee.  Make
the conditions for triggering compactions fire in more situations?
